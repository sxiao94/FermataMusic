<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sjvnnBz.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We created our app to address the problem of bringing age old sheet music to the digital age. We envisioned a sleek easy to use iPad application that brought together all the tools musicians use on a daily basis. Our solution is Fermata Sheet Music.  </p>

<a id="our-process" class="anchor" href="#our-process" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our Process</h3>

<p>For our project we worked mainly with Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) files. MIDI files are the technical standard in the industry concerning music as they carry information that specifies pitch, notation, velocity, as well as a plethora of other related data. Our first and arguably most important task to complete was the parsing of the MIDI files themselves. With the given MIDI data, how could we transform it into the sheet music that  we all know and use today. </p>

<p>Our project is mostly coded in Swift, the newest and fastest growing programming language of iOS and OS X. There are certain features however that could only be accomplished in Javascript. One of these is Vexflow,a Javascript library used in parsing and displaying MIDI files. Thus the parsing of the MIDI files was done mostly in Javascript, then embedded into the main Swift code.

<p>Our MIDI files themselves are saved onto a mySQL database and pulled when needed. The pulling of the MIDI files are performed with PHP calls. </p>

<p>We are excited to continue improving our application and polishing it into the app that we envisioned at the beginnning of the year. We have most of our vital features completeed at this time, however there are still some implementation issues to work out. </p>
