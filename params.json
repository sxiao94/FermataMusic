  "body": "### Fermata Sheet Music - Our Vision\r\n\r\nWe created our app to address the problem of bringing age old sheet music to the digital age. We envisioned a sleek easy to use iPad application that brought together all the tools musicians use on a daily basis. Our solution is Fermata Sheet Music.  \r\n\r\n### Our Process\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nEric Chanthorabout : \r\n\r\nEugene Raygorodetskiy:\r\n\r\nKyle Roush:\r\n\r\nSamuel Benson:\r\n\r\nSikai Xiao:\r\n\r\nYoung Liu: \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
