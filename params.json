  "body": "### Fermata Sheet Music - Our Vision\r\n![](http://imgur.com/sjvnnBz)\r\nWe created our app to address the problem of bringing age old sheet music to the digital age. We envisioned a sleek easy to use iPad application that brought together all the tools musicians use on a daily basis. Our solution is Fermata Sheet Music.  \r\n\r\n### Our Process\r\n\r\nFor our project we worked mainly with Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) files. MIDI files are the technical standard in the industry concerning music as they carry information that specifies pitch, notation, velocity, as well as a plethora of other related data. Our first and arguably most important task to complete was the parsing of the MIDI files themselves. With the given MIDI data, how could we transform it into the sheet music that  we all know and use today. \r\n\r\nOur MIDI files themselves are saved onto a PHP database. \r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nEric Chanthorabout : \r\n\r\nEugene Raygorodetskiy:\r\n\r\nKyle Roush:\r\n\r\nSamuel Benson:\r\n\r\nSikai Xiao:\r\n\r\nYoung Liu: \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
