We envisioned a sleek easy to use iPad application that brought together all the tools musicians use on a daily basis. Our solution is Fermata Sheet Music.  \r\n\r\n### Our Process\r\n\r\nFor our project we worked mainly with Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) files. MIDI files are the technical standard in the industry concerning music as they carry information that specifies pitch, notation, velocity, as well as a plethora of other related data. Our first and arguably most important task to complete was the parsing of the MIDI files themselves. With the given MIDI data, how could we transform it into the sheet music that  we all know and use today. \r\n\r\nOur project is mostly coded in Swift, the newest and fastest growing programming language of iOS and OS X. There are certain features however that could only be accomplished in Javascript. One of these is Vexflow,a Javascript library used in parsing and displaying MIDI files. Thus the parsing of the MIDI files was done mostly in Javascript, then embedded into the main Swift code.\r\n\r\nOur Parser Parses MIDI data like this... \r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/bAFGFNC.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur MIDI files themselves are saved onto a mySQL database and pulled when needed. The pulling of the MIDI files are performed with PHP calls. \r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/244gpuu.png)\r\nPHP Calls used to pull MIDI data from the database\r\n\r\n\r\nOur database organizes our application and keeps detailed tables that track how elements of the application interact with one another. \r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/LH9n4lH.png)\r\n\r\nOur table of songs that are sotred in our database. \r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/yTK1JnN.png)\r\nRelational Schema detailing how the different aspects of our application interact with one another. \r\n\r\n### Features\r\nIt wasn't enough for us to just display music on an iPad. We wanted to provide additional features and tools that musicians of all levels would use on a daily basis.\r\n\r\n### Metronome\r\nThe metronome is an essential tool in any musician's repertoire. Following along with the beat while you play has never been easier with Fermata. \r\n\r\n### Tuner\r\nThe majority of instruments need to be tuned regularly to ensure proper pitch. The tuner that we currently have implemented is the most traditional type. It plays a note at the exact frequency and pitch and the user then adjusts their instrument to match the given pitch. We hope to build on the tuner by also allowing the option for dynamic tuning. This feature would basically \"hear\" what the user plays and then tells the user how to adjust accordingly. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Markups \r\n\r\nA feature we have yet to build is the option for users to mark up their music and add in personal comments. This is extremely useful for any musician who wishes to personalize their music and make it easier for their personal uses. Below is a mockup of what we hope to accomplish. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Follow - Along\r\nOne of the main problems of sheet music that we wanted to address was to get rid of noisey page turns. This can be accomplished with Follow - Along, our feature that would basically scroll down the music autonomously while the musician is playing. This is a feature we have yet to accomplish and hope to be able to implement by the end of the semester.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nEric Chanthorabout : \r\n\r\nEugene Raygorodetskiy:\r\n\r\nKyle Roush:\r\n\r\nSamuel Benson:\r\n\r\nSikai Xiao:\r\n\r\nYoung Liu: \r\n\r\n### Looking Forward\r\n\r\nWe are excited to continue improving our application and polishing it into the app that we envisioned at the beginning of the year. We have our vital features completed at this time, however there is still Markups and Follow - Along to incorporate. Overall the app still lacks some polish and this will be our main focus going into the rest of the semester. ",
